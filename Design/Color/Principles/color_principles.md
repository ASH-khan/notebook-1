#Color Principles

All of these principles can be applied in unique ways to guide the human eye,
affecting both color and contrast.

**Color Structure**
  - Value
  - Hue
  - Saturation

**Size**

**Focus**

###Color Relationships

**Rule #1:** No such thing as a good color, only good color relationships.
**Rule #2:** Text must have contrast of value if you want viewers to read the text.

_Note:_ Working with analogous colors can help narrow down the focus of a palette.

#####Shifting Color Palettes
Here are ways to shift an existing color palette to help a group of colors
work together:

- Shift the hues

- Add value, saturation, and hue

- Take away or add saturation.

- Tinting colors (Adding white aka 'pastels')

- Shading colors (Adding black)

- Toning colors (Adding grey or tinting + shading)
