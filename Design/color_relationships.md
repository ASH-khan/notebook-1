# Color Relationships

### Complementary Colors

Complementary colors are colors that clash with each other. The are found opposite of each other on the color wheel. But they can work with one another on various levels.

One way to tell if colors are complementary is to mix the two and if the color perfectly between them is middle grey than they are complementary.

Complementary colors usually work best together within the middle third of the gradient because the colors have cross-bred and have tight relationships. When using this method to create a palette note that there will be no real value change, so create tints or shades for better results.

### Refining a Palette

Similar to working with Fonts, you don't want too many colors in your palette. Depending on things like readability of text and the context you are going for, you can narrow down your selection.

When you have narrowed down to a few colors, you can further define by making variations of value of those colors (tints and shades). Try to keep the steps in value incremental.
