# Overview

## What is JSON?

JSON stands for _JavaScript Object Notation_, and is a universal format for sharing data. Just as the name might suggest, JSON derives from JavaScript syntax. Despite this, JSON is language independent, making it easy to work with across different platforms and languages. It is an alternative to XML, which many developers have found harder to work with.

**Advantages of using JSON:**

  * Easy to read
  * Easy to parse
  * Leaner than XML
  * Growing Support for API's
  * Natural Format for JavaScript
  * Implementation in many languages
