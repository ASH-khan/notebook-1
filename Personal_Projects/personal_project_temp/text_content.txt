Camera -

Sometimes I enjoy viewing the world through a looking glass.
Photography provides me with a unique perspective on life.
Whether its in the city or out in the boondocks,
I'll try to capture it all.

Coffee -

Early on in life there wasn't anything I hated more than coffee, the smell, the taste, especially the look of it.
Over the years, what started out as an acquired taste evolved into an obsession.
Today, coffee is the fuel that drives me through life.
Sometimes I honestly think I could conquer the world with enough it!

Video Games -

Although I don't play as many video games today as I did in the "Golden Age" of my youth,
there will always be a place in my heart for those classic game systems like the Super Nintendo, N64, and Gameboy.
My perspective on gaming has changed since I began taking an interest in programming,
but it has allowed me to appreciate the experience in a different way.

Music -

Music plays a huge role in my life. I have enjoyed various genres of music over the years,
the most recent being Jazz. Some of my favorite artists are Miles Davis, Grant Green, and John Coltrane, all masters of their craft.
If I could go back in time, I would have made it a point to be able to read and play music.

Dog -

I love all animals, but I especially love dogs. I am firm believer they really are man's best friend.
My best friend is Coco. She is a five-year old black lab mix, and day doesn't go by that we don't spend time together.
If it wasn't for Coco, I wouldn't be taking those much needed breaks from being in front of a computer screen.

Skateboarding -

Nothing quite releases stress like skateboarding. Although it can be humbling at times, especially when you take a slam,
there is a deep satisfaction being able to move freely on a board. It's the closest thing to having super-powers other than programming.
