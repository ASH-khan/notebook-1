# CodePen Ideas

### Color Exercises:

**Swatches**

  - Value
  - Hue
  - Saturation

  Using the idea that value, hue, and saturation are the three pillars of color,
  create a simple canvas with a colored square on a colored background.
  When the user clicks, the background becomes the square, and a new color is
  made the background. This exercise shows how colors are relative and can
  change based on their environment. A dropdown select box will allow the user
  to pick one of the three pillars that would then be exemplified.

**Sizes**

  Create a canvas animation that shows relativity of size. In a basic sense it
  can show real ratios between planets. The idea is that the animation would
  cycle through all heavenly bodies in our solar system (including moons),
  showing their relative sizes in comparison with one another.

**Bouncing Ball Animation**

  Animate a bouncing ball on the screen that changes hue, saturation,
  or value relative to the velocity at which it is moving.

**Photo/Film Grain**

  Animate a flash of different colored lines to simulate
  color film grain effect.

**French-Press Timer**

  This delightful pen would be a simple timer, which the user can set or reset
  (if it is already running). As the time decreases the press is pressed down
  further and further until the timer finishes.

**VR Mouse Clipping**

  Play a video in html canvas and using the clip() function allow the user to 'look-around' by dragging their mouse.

**Image Deconstruction**

  Use the image drawing capabilities of canvas to randomly splice up chunks of an image and re-arrage it.
